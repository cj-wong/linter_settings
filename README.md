# Linter Settings

## Overview

These are the linter settings I use for my projects. I started linting code since late October 2020, so older code may not be up-to-date on linting.

## Usage

Run [link_linter.sh](link_linter.sh) to automatically link linter settings files. Install appropriate linting tools as necessary. In my case, that includes [SublimeLinter] and all of its associated plug-ins.

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of the linters or any linting tools I use, including but not limited to [Sublime Text], [SublimeLinter], `Flake8`, and `ShellCheck`. See [LICENSE](LICENSE) for more detail.
